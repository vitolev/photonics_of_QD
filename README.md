# Photonics of Quantum Dots
This is a repository for article I have written: *Photonics of Quantum Dots*.
At first this was an article created for seminar during physics course at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in Ljubljana and was later adapted and improved to be published in an online magazine [Matrika](https://matrika.fmf.uni-lj.si/). The article is also available at https://matrika.fmf.uni-lj.si/letnik-11/stevilka-2/levstik.html.

The language of the article is in Slovene, with an abstract also in English. When (if) I will have time, I will also rewrite it to English.
